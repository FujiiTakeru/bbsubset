## Whatâ€™s this for ?

Designing *good* custom DNA barcodes and selecting a *good* subset of oligo pool
in your lab. is a problem of combinatorial optimizations.

This R package `bbsubset` is dedicated for the purpose, and select a subset of DNA sequences
that are *well-balanced* in terms of nucleosties composition.

## Installation

`install.packages("devtools")` if you haven't installed it.

Then run,

``` r
devtools::install_github("tfwis/bbsubset")
```

## The wrokflow

* Step1: Prepere your input DNA pool
* Step2: Choose LP solver (optional)
* Step3: Extract subset from the pool by `bbsubset`

## Tutorial

#### Load packages

Please confirm that these packages are installed before trying this tutorial.

``` r
library(ROI)
library(slam)
```

#### Create barcode set by `DNABarcodes`

[`DNABarcodes`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DNABarcodes/inst/doc/DNABarcodes.html) is
the great tool for creating error torelant barcode set.

Let us use this as a starting material of DNA barcode pool.

``` r
barcodes <- DNABarcodes::create.dnabarcodes(n=6, dist=3)
#> 1) Creating pool ...  of size 1160
#> 2) Conway closing...  done
```
This procuces the pool of 6 length DNA barcodes
with 3 hamming distance from each other
(i.e., 1 error correction is available).

### Select LP solver (optional)

`bbsubset` is free to select LP solver via ROI infrastructure.

The default solver is lpsolve`. If you want to run `bbsubset`
by default, load `ROI.plugin.lpsolve`.

``` r
library(ROI.plugin.lpsolve)
```

### Extract subset

Select well-balanced 12 barcodes from the barcode pool.

``` r
myset <- bbsubset::bbsubset(barcodes,12)
myset$subset
#>  [1] "CCACAA" "GCGTAA" "TACGCA" "ATGGAG" "ACAAGG" "CTTAGG" "TGCATC" "AAGGTC"
#>  [9] "GAACTC" "TGTCGT" "CTCTCT" "GGTTCT"
```

### Validate nucleotide balance

`basecomp` to show nucleotides numbers at each position (1-6).

``` r
bbsubset::basecomp(myset$subset)
#>   [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]
#> A    3    3    3    3    3    3
#> C    3    3    3    3    3    3
#> T    3    3    3    3    3    3
#> G    3    3    3    3    3    3
```

This result is perfect.

## Advanced options

### Setting timeout in LP solve

You can set a timeout to limit the computation time.

Since the name of the option is depend on the selected solver,
please see the reference manuals. 

The following example set limtits up to 10 seconds in `lpsolve`.

``` r
myset <- bbsubset::bbsubset(barcodes,5,timeout=10) 
```

### Gurobi solver

To use commercial solver like gurobi, then.

``` r
library(ROI.plugin.gurobi)
myset <- bbsubset::bbsubset(barcodes,12,solver="gurobi")
bbsubset::basecomp(myset$subset)
#>   1bp 2bp 3bp 4bp 5bp 6bp
#> A   3   3   3   3   3   3
#> C   3   3   3   3   3   3
#> T   3   3   3   3   3   3
#> G   3   3   3   3   3   3
```
